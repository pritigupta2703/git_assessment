# GIT Assessment

Create a screencast for each scenario. Feel free to google / refer the ppt for commands / syntax.

# Scenario 1 - Starting from scratch.

> You are creating your own version of “Facebook”. You have your code on you now the next step is to start using a VCS to track changes and collaborate with your ever increasing team.

> Create some dummy files in a directory, this would be the code base to your new social network, initialize a repo.

> Create a .project file in your repo. We don’t want the .project file to go into the repo what will you do?

> Make changes to a few files of your choice and reset only a specific file to the remote copy

> Keep checking the status whenever you make any git related changes.

> Create a remote repo on GITHUB. Push changes to a remote repo.

> Make at least 4 commits and check the commit history both on Github and locally.

# Scenario 2 - Fork a repo.

> Fork the repo “https://github.com/arvindkasale08/git_assessment”

> Clone the forked repo.

> View remote information and verify that the correct remote is added as origin.

> Its your task to add a “BENEFITS” feature for our Users.

> Create and work in a new branch

> Go ahead and create a few txt files in controllers / models folder to simulate a new feature. 

> Make sure you add atleast 3 commits in the new branch.

> Check the differences between the new branch and the master.

> View all branches present as well as remote branches. How do you do it?

> Push the new branch to Github.

> Squash the commits into one for the new branch.

> Merge the new branch to master and delete the feature branch.

> End with creating a pull request on Github for me to review your new features. (Use Google to know how to do it.)

# Scenario 3 - Cloning and Rebasing.

> Start by again cloning  “https://github.com/arvindkasale08/git_assessment”. DO NOT FORK IT

> Its your task to add a “Roles” feature for your Users.

> Create and work in a new branch

> Go ahead and create a few txt files in controller / models folder to simulate a new feature.

> Again make sure you have atleast 3 commits in your feature branch.

> Fetch the latest master and Rebase your feature branch with the latest master too.

> Merge the rebased feature branch into master.

> You should squash your feature commits into one commit.

> End by pushing the master branch to remote.
